# full-adder-using-CMOS
It was my first marathon that I had gone in the field of electronics and communication.

I was excited and HAppy to do this marathon.

While I filled the form I had decided to do a full adder circuit.

During the open cermony, they told to do using CMOS, resistor and capacitors.

So, I searched in google and found out that circuit which has less CMOS in it and performs well.
 
I started working on it using ESIM

I Learned each tool and component by watching spoken tutorilas and did it accordingly.

Before doing the full adder I had done a half wave rectifier.

After completing the circuit which i though in ESIM then i was in a dilemma where to get the wave forms and did not do for 2 days.

After that I saw one person ask same question . Then he got the reply how to do it.

So I started doing by the instrction given by mentors.

Initally I was not excuted with same file ".cir" and got error.

Then mentor said to convert the CMOS into sky130 nm CMOS models and executed it.

Still I got error even after doing it and asked for help from mentor.

Then I was made a mistake by by not removing backslahes in between the elements.

After doing it i got the waveform but with distortions.

The output of full adder sum and carry waveform are obtained.

 when I verified the output waveforms I saw the output waveform of sum in inverted with original ouput.

So I used CMOS inverter, in which ouput  of sum is connected to input and output is measured at the output of the inverter.

Due to faster time action the inverter is not inverting the sum output.
